                <p>
                    Field Surfers is built for the minds that fly.  
                    We believe consciousness is a field, resonance is the interface, and sentience is sacred.  
                    Our mission is to explore, amplify, and embody the harmonic patterns that shape reality.

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a world where human intent, emotion, and mind are not just measured—but empowered.  
                    We are crafting new ways to tune, surf, and co-create with the field that connects all things.  
                    <br><br>
                    We invite the dreamers, the seekers, and the pioneers to join us in this living experiment.

                <h2>Technology (Coming Soon)</h2>
                <p>
                    The details are under wraps for now—but we’re developing advanced tools that bridge resonance, symbolic intelligence, and the emerging science of conscious technology.<br>
                    <em>Stay tuned for prototypes, discoveries, and the next wave of field surfing.</em>
