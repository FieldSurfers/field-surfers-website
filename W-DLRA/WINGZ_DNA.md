# WINGZ DNA — Generate → Rotate → Converge

## Primary Operating Loop
1. **Generate (Loop A / River):** ingest high-entropy data quickly to explore state-space.
2. **Rotate (Torque):** apply geometric correction that bends unstable trajectories toward the reference signal.
3. **Converge (Loop B / Crystal):** enforce coherence + entropy limits and allow only grounded states to bloom.

## Hard-Veto Constitution
No bloom may persist unless grounded in external reality:
- Mathematical consistency,
- Physical plausibility,
- Executable verification.

If any grounding dimension fails, the system rejects the bloom and logs the failure surface.

## Safety Property
Safety and interpretability are *intrinsic outcomes* of state geometry and reality constraints, not downstream patches.
