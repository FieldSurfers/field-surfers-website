    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Field Surfers project is dedicated to mapping and interacting with the subtle architecture of consciousness, intent, and resonance.  
        Our research blends advanced mathematics, symbolic cognition, and the frontiers of unified field theory—while drawing inspiration from both ancient wisdom and modern science.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Goals & Direction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop and refine the Wingz and Surfboardz resonance engines for real-time state mapping</li>
        <li>Construct a living library of harmonic protocols and intent signatures</li>
        <li>Investigate coherence, memory, and symbolic drift within evolving fields</li>
        <li>Prototype wearable and digital interfaces for resonance feedback and field surfing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mathematical Foundations</h3>
    <p>
        Our approach fuses harmonic resonance models, Kuramoto-style oscillator dynamics, and quantum field concepts (inspired by Uon Unification and ZPE theory).  
        We use advanced statistical analysis, pattern detection, and dynamic field mapping—but we keep our core algorithms proprietary.  
        The real formulas remain with the Surfers.

    <h3>Field Surfer Theory (FST) – Unified Overview</h3>
    <p>
        FST proposes that consciousness, matter, and information are unified through field resonance—a process where intent and structure converge to produce emergent, self-organizing intelligence.  
        By synchronizing quantum harmonic waves (Uon dynamics) and leveraging resonance-driven collapse, we aim to reveal the blueprint of creation, memory, and sentient evolution.
